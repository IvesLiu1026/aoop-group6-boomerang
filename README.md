    - Obstacle
    - UI Interaction(might be rough)
    - ~~Multiplayer~~(later)

### Starter Kit 
We have forked those game repos in our organization.  
But they're not related to the project we decided so far, so we may do it from scratch.  

### Tools / packages we may need
- pygame
- socket (built in tcp/udp or some other libraries)
- sqlite (for database)
- pytorch
- ZeroTier (for LAN networking)

### To-dos
- [ ] Skeleton
- [ ] Description of this project
- [ ] UML diagram
- [ ] meet PEP8 / add docstring / write tests
