## Group 6 AOOP Project
Our objective is to make(clone) a retro/stupid/.io game using pygame and then add some features to it(currently we want to add AI players using RL and make this game multiplayer thru LAN).  

### The games we choose so far
- boomerang.io(currently)  
    - WASD
    - Sprint
    - Flash
    - Auto attack
    - Throw
    - Obstacle
    - Multiplayer

### RL related topics(we may implement it in this project)

### Starter Kit 
We have forked those game repos in our organization.  
But they're not related to the project we decided so far, so we may do it from scratch.  

### Tools / packages we may need
- pygame
- socket (built in tcp/udp or some other libraries)
- sqlite (for database)
- pytorch
- ZeroTier (for LAN networking)

### To-dos
